# How to get started contributing to yearn

Welcome to Yearn!

We are excited for your interest in yearn. Yearn is a decentralized flat organization that is open to all contributors whether you have experience in web3 or not.

To get started, be sure to join the discord server here: https://discord.gg/828PFQBv and visit the **#contributooooors** channel. Feel free to use this channel to get help or ask questions.

The process to contribute is simple. Find an open issue that interests you on this page: https://contribute.yearn.rocks and then mention on the github issue that you would like to work on it. This will let others know that the issue is being worked on so that contributors don't overlap.

Each issue is correlated with a repository in the [yearn organization](https://github.com/yearn). Next, clone the repository that the issue corresponds to and then apply your changes to solve the issue. When committing, follow the [conventional commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Once the changes are ready to be reviewed and your code has been tested, open a PR to the main repository. For active repositories, someone may review it automatically but sometimes you would need to ping someone in the discord to get it looked at.

That's it! Happy developing and [take the blue pill](https://thebluepill.eth.limo/)
